##Introduction

Magento application implements the Model-view-controller architecture pattern; meaning, the Magento software is architected into layers, including the view layer.

The major part of the view layer of Magento application is layout. Functionally, layout is a page structure, represented by hierarchy of elements (element tree), which can be of two types: blocks and containers. Technically, layout is defined in the .xml files, which contain element declarations and element manipulation instructions.
