#Responsive Web Design in Magento

Responsive web design (RWD, also referred as responsive design) crafts web sites to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices (from large, high-resolution desktop computer monitors to mobile phones).

The out of the box Magento Blank and Luma themes (Luma inherits from Blank) use the mobile first RWD approach. It is ensured mostly by means of CSS and JavaScript.
